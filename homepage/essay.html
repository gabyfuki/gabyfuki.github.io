        <h2>86th and Third</h2>
        <p id ="essay"> When walking in Leo’s, the owner greets you with a loving smile and strikes up a convo. The smell of rich tomato sauce overcomes your nose as your mouth salivates. You overhear conversations from the families sitting at the booths or the couples you know are in love just by seeing the way they look at one another. In its prime, the restaurant was always buzzing and busy, overwhelming but calm at the same time. The workers and waiters were always eager to serve and chat. The men that made the pizza would always tell us how long ago the pie was made, and if we were unsatisfied with that answer they would make us a fresh pie. The host would always give us the table we wanted. My mom is and has always been a big fan of outdoor dining, but the rest of my family isn’t. The indoor-outdoor element of Leo’s made it perfect for us. </p>
        <p id ="essay"> The funny thing is that if you asked the entirety of New York City where you could get the best pizza you would get hundreds of answers. A New Yorkers favorite pizza spot has less to do with if it's actually the best pizza and more to do with each individual's personal New York and what that pizza place means to them. Ever since I was a kid, if anyone wanted pizza we would go to Leo’s; we would dine in and take out, always loyal to our spot. We were also loyal to our pizza, the square grandma pizza. Whether it was a slice or a pie, we always got Leo’s grandma pizza - sometimes we would throw in a calzone or an order of garlic knots, but the pizza order never changed. One day, about two years ago, I got the devastating news the Leo’s was closing. My whole family panicked until we came to know that they were just moving to a smaller establishment and our hearts eased.</p>
        <p id ="essay"> My feelings about this spot, on the corner of 86th and Tthird, have changed dramatically over the last two years. In the years prior every time I walked by the big red square-shaped establishment, my heart got warm and my stomach grumbled, pulling me inside for a slice. When I walk by it now, I am filled with resentment for the new Turkish restaurant that has replaced my family’s favorite. Although I have never eaten at the new restaurant every time I see it I am saddened. To the best of my knowledge, the new Turkish place could have some of the best food in our neighborhood, but in the two years that it has been standing there I haven’t dared to bring myself inside because I know that I would have to face one of the best parts of my personal New York just gone. I am stupid to say that I am frustrated with the way the Turkish restaurant replaced Leo’s. The irony is that my favorite restaurant, Leo’s, most likely replaced another person's favorite. That establishment destroyed another New Yorkers favorite place, and this Turkish restaurant could very well be someone's new favorite, a significant part of their personal NYC. That person is filled with joy, while I am filled with resentment about the same place on the same block. That's the crazy thing about New York, it’s always changing and it always will be.</p>
        <p id ="essay"> The reason I am frustrated every time I walk by and long to see the nice men throwing and stretching the soft pillowy, cloud-like dough with their hands and sprinkling the gooey mozzarella cheese onto the pizza like a thick layer of snow is because this restaurant has been there through everything with me as a kid. Whenever there was something to celebrate or a special occasion we got Leo’s pizza. Whenever I was feeling down and needed some good food we would get Leo’s. Leo’s is the reason I would say pizza is my favorite food. As the years went by I associated the restaurant and its pizza with happiness. I look back at those times now and wonder if I'll ever find a place like that again. In a way I know I will. I’m sure there will be tons of places in the future that mean so much more than Leo’s did, but in a way, I know there won’t. Leo’s was my childhood, it was my memories. When Leo’s put up the piece of printer paper that read “This establishment is closing” undeniably my heart crushed, and naturally, I was upset and frustrated. Why would I want something replacing my beloved memories? The spot I could always trust to be there for me just wasn't anymore.</p>
